I wanted to create a bold design that captured some of the "Old West" nostaglia of the 29 Mule story and frontier mining, while also being modern and forward-thinking.

I began this project with pencil thumbnails for ideas of a logo a design elements. After developing a logo and color palette, I designed the various business products.
