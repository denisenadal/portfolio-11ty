Create a single page app to make it easy for students to find tutoring sessions for their classes. The interface needed to clean, simple and mobile-friendly, and the calendar needed to be easy to update by someone of basic computer skills. The final product was built using WordPress,  javascript, jQuery and Googleâ€™s Calendar API.
