Pathways is a feature I led the product development process for during Spring 2024 for EcoMap. It was my first time leading the process from start to finish with a team of designers and engineers. We conducted thorough research with our customers to understand their pain points. 

Thanks to having that research to ground our design, the customers in our beta release saw double the engagement time, and triple the user retention. This feature earned a nomination for Product of the Year 2024 by Technical.ly Baltimore.
