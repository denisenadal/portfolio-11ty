We conducted interviews with several different customers, including the one who was initially sold the feature. We found some commonalities in pain points in their workflow, and things that they wished the product could do to scale up and automate their daily tasks.  We decided to do some quick wireframes of some of our ideas and bounce them off of the customers to get some early feedback. It was very helpful and  helped us pivot quickly from designs that would be confusing. After conducting these interviews, and reviewing these early designs, we put together a presentation summarizing our results.
