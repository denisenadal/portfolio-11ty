## The Challenge

In early 2024, our design team inherited an unusual problem: our previous CEO had successfully sold a new feature called "Pathways" to a key customer, but left behind no documentation about what it was supposed to do. We had a committed customer, a development timeline, and absolutely no clarity on the actual product requirements.

## Uncovering the Real Problem

Rather than guess what "Pathways" should be, we took a step back to understand the fundamental customer need. I led our team through a Value Proposition Canvas exercise to map out what we knew versus what we needed to discover.

### Research Approach

- **Customer interviews** with multiple clients, including the original requestor
- **Workflow analysis** to identify common pain points across customer segments
- **Early concept testing** with lo-fi wireframes to validate directions quickly

### Key Insights

Through our interviews, we discovered customers were struggling with:

- Manual, repetitive tasks that didn't scale with their growing practices
- Workflow inefficiencies that created bottlenecks in supporting entrepreneurial growth
- Need for automation in their daily entrepreneurial support processes

*"The research phase was crucial - it helped us pivot away from confusing design directions before we invested too much development time."*
