In early 2024, the design team was tasked with designing a new feature called Pathways. Our previous CEO and product lead had sold this new feature to a customer, but didnâ€™t leave any notes on what the feature was supposed to be. Our task was to understand what the customer pain point was, the product need, and how to quickly iterate a solution.

We began our process by filling out a Value Prop canvas with what we knew, and what we hypothesized. Through this process we identified actionable product needs, and possible solutions. Now that we had a general idea, it was time to do some  first-hand research with our customers to better understand the problem.
