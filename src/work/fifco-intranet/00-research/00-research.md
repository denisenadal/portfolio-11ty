    <div class="col col-12  md-8 lg-6">
    <div class="p-2 text-light bg-cyan mb-2">

### Business goals

- Need an easy way to share and update content with all FIFCO employees, including Costa Rica, that works on any device. The existing solution (sharepoint) is full of outdated content, is difficult to use, and not responsive.
- Need a single source of truth for company policies and procedures and place to embody company culture and drive change.
- **What outcomes do you want to achieve â€” are they measurable?**
    - Improve communication between CR and USA
    - Improve cross functional communication between teams
    - Less duplication of resources

    ### Product Purpose
    Build a content management system for a company-wide intranet system. It should be a one-stop destination for information about company policies, procedures and news.

    ### Target audience
    **FIFCOUSA Employees.** They will be looking for company policies, procedures, information, and news. We want then to view the newsletter and engage with timely content
    - this includes employees who are not tech savvy, do not have FIFCO accounts, may not have smart phones
    - some do not speak english (costa rica)
    - disabilities/accessibility issues.

## User Research
We used a combination of interviews and surveys to uncover the common needs of employees at FIFCO USA. Based on the responses we received we were able to determine what content needed to be added to the site and what links needed highest visibility and ease of access. We were able to use these insights to design our site navigation and information architecture.
