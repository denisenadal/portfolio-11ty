For development, I started by building a static site containing examples of all the page templates I would need to create. For the styling, I used the Material Design Boostrap library to set us up and running faster. I then set up a local copy of WordPress using the Local by Flywheel app, and the Understrap theme. From there I was able to put my static site's code into the Understrap theme and start to customize it as needed. 

From there, I just had to build and test all the page templates, widgets, custon plugins, and set up all the sites and plugins.
