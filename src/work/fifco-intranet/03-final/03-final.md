## Key Learnings

### Inclusive Design Research
Working with such a diverse user base (varying tech skills, languages, device access, and abilities) reinforced the importance of comprehensive user research that accounts for real-world constraints, not just ideal user scenarios.

### Cross-Cultural UX Considerations
Designing for international teams requires understanding not just language differences, but varying work patterns, technology access, and communication preferences across cultures.

### Stakeholder Collaboration in Enterprise UX
Successfully managing multiple stakeholders (IT, Talent Team, various departments) while maintaining user-centered design principles required clear communication of research findings and design rationale.

### Resource-Constrained Innovation
Building a comprehensive intranet alongside regular duties demonstrated how strategic planning and phased development can achieve significant UX improvements within limited resources.

### Content Strategy as UX Foundation
The project reinforced that information architecture based on actual user research creates more successful experiences than assumptions about what users "should" want.

## Design Process Innovation

### Research-Driven Information Architecture
The combination of surveys and interviews provided both quantitative priority data and qualitative insights into user mental models, creating a more nuanced understanding than either method alone.

### Collaborative Design Validation
Using Figma prototypes for stakeholder testing enabled rapid iteration and ensured the final design met both user needs and organizational requirements.

### Technical UX Integration
Leading both design and development provided unique insights into how technical decisions impact user experience, enabling more informed trade-offs between functionality and usability.
