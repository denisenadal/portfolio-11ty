### Usability Testing

I conducted moderated usability tests with a specific scenario: *"Find options for a summer bootcamp for students"* (knowing 2+ matching programs existed).

<div class="bg-lemon">

**Results revealed:**

- **75% failure rate** - most users never found matching results
- **2-5 minute task times** for the 25% who succeeded
- **Only 10% found results quickly and confidently**
- Users expressed frustration with multiple, confusing search paths

### Key Insights:

1. **Cognitive overload:** Too many search options paralyzed users
2. **Scanning difficulties:** Grid layouts hindered quick information processing
3. **Performance expectations:** Slow load times eroded user trust
4. **Information hierarchy:** Critical details were buried or inconsistent

### Competitive Research

Working with our junior designer Hope, together we analyzed search design patterns and user behavior research to identify best practices for information architecture and search result presentation.
