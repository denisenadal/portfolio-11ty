### Information Architecture Redesign

**Solution:** Consolidate multiple search entry points into one prominent, always-visible search bar with filtered results pages.

**Challenge:** Existing customer contracts specified separate directory features, such as a "job directory", "talent directory", "events directory", etc, preventing complete consolidation.

**Compromise:** Emphasized the unified search bar in top navigation while maintaining contractually required separate directories.

### Search Results Layout Redesign

**Research-driven decision:** Switched from grid to list layout based on scanning behavior studies.

**Benefits:**

- More text and tags visible per result card
- Improved information hierarchy for quick scanning
- Better accommodation of variable data fields

### Flexible Design System

**Major constraint:** Each customer's data was tagged differently - inconsistent schemas meant location might be tagged as "county" for one client but "city, county, state" for another.

**Solution:** Designed a flexible component system that could accommodate variable data structures while maintaining visual consistency and hierarchy.
