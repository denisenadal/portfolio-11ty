Based on this project's success, I identified opportunities for future improvements:

- **Data standardization initiative** to improve filter functionality
- **Personalization** based on user roles and previous searches
- **Analytics integration** for continuous UX optimization
- **Saved Searches and Notifications** allowing users to “save” a search and be notified when new items match their search criteria
