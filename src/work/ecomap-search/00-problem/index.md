Our platform served as a resource directory for various organizations, but customer feedback and support tickets revealed a critical usability issue: **users couldn't find what they were looking for**.

### Key Pain Points Identified:

- **Navigation confusion:** 3-12 different search entry points overwhelmed users
- **Poor task completion:** Only 1 in 4 users could find matching results for specific queries
- **Performance issues:** Search pages took 5-7 seconds to load (up to 12 seconds)
- **Low user confidence:** Even successful users were unsure if their results were correct

- Improve customer satisfaction scores
- Reduce search-related support tickets
