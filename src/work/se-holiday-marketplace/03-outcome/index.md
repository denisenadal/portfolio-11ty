### Scalable Design Systems
Working with 1,600+ businesses taught me the importance of designing flexible, scalable component systems that maintain consistency while accommodating diverse content types and quality levels.

### Technical Problem-Solving
The web scraping solution demonstrated how technical creativity can solve UX problems - by standardizing inconsistent data sources, we created a cohesive user experience despite varied input quality.

### Social Impact Design
This project reinforced how thoughtful UX design can amplify social good initiatives, making meaningful impact more accessible to users while achieving business objectives.

### Performance as User Experience
The static site generation approach proved that technical architecture decisions directly impact user experience - fast loading times were crucial for holiday shopping success.

### Collaborative Design Process
Working closely with brand stakeholders while maintaining user-centered design principles showed how collaborative iteration can achieve both business and user goals effectively.
