### Information Architecture & Wireframing
Collaborated with the brand team to establish the site structure:
- **Homepage:** Featured business spotlight with clear value proposition
- **Category pages:** Organized browsing by business type
- **Business directory:** Comprehensive listing with search/filter capabilities
- **About/FAQ pages:** Mission explanation and user guidance

Created initial wireframes that balanced business showcase needs with user browsing patterns, iterating collaboratively until the structure met both user and business requirements.

### Visual Design System Integration
**Challenge:** Maintain Seagram's Escapes brand consistency while creating a distinct marketplace identity.

**Approach:** Developed component variations that aligned with existing brand guidelines while optimizing for:

- **Business profile cards** with consistent information hierarchy
- **Search and filter interfaces** for easy discovery

**Deliverables:** Multiple layout and component design variations, allowing stakeholders to choose options that best balanced brand alignment with marketplace functionality.
