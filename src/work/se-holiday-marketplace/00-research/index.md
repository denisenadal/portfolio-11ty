In 2020, Seagram's Escapes wanted to create meaningful impact by supporting Black-owned small businesses during the holiday shopping season. They needed a comprehensive marketplace platform that could:

- Showcase a large number of businesses (initially unknown scale, ultimately 1,600+)
- Enable easy product discovery across diverse business categories
- Launch quickly to maximize holiday shopping impact
- Align with brand standards while serving a social good mission
- Scale efficiently without extensive backend infrastructure
