After establishing a deep understanding of who we were designing for and understanding the tasks involved, I did a lot of loose sketching on paper to work out my initial ideas. From there I worked up several wireframes, some of which are detailed in the next section

##### Wireframing through a Scenario

Part of validating this design and workflow was running it through several common and uncommon scenarios. To the left is an example for a common scenario that can be challenging - a landlord calls to schedule work at a tenant's home.
