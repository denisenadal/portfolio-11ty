### Idea Generation

Most of EcoMapâ€™ customers are local and state governments, universities and non-profit foundations. These types of customers have an interest in providing accessible services and tools, and many have procurement requirements requiring ADA and WCAG compliance.  Therefore it was important for EcoMap to be able to say that all of our product could meet those standards.

### Research & Planning

I had a lot of previous knowledge of WCAG standards from my previous experience working at Utah Tech University and FIFCO, bot of which prioritized meeting those standards for their websites. Because of my experience, I took on the process of researching what standards would apply to our platform, and breaking it down into a project plan for our team to follow, although finding time to work on it during our sprints was always a challenge. 

When EcoMap hired several computer science interns for the summer in 2024, we had one, Cameron, focus on our accessibility project along with our junior developer Duncan. 

### Implementation

To keep our intern Cameron from feeling overwhelmed and lost, I performed a platform wide accessibility audit, and put my findings into a spreadsheet. We then used the spreadsheet to break down the work into specific, concrete tasks that could be checked off. On the first day, I explained accessibility standards to Duncan and Cameron, and showed them how to remediate each issue, such as color contrasts, font sizes, tab order, focus traps, etc. Then Cameron went to work, and Duncan and I performed regular reviews of her improvements. By the end of her summer internship, we had completed improving all of the identified issued and could say that our  primary product was ADA, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant!

### Result

By doing the work to make sure our platforms met the WCAG 2.1 AA standards, we were able to renew contracts with several universities, and were now able to reapproach several customers that had WCAG requirements before we could close a deal.
