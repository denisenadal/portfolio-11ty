This idea was initiated by our CEO & founder Pava. During meetings with customers and prospects, she identified a common need for a community portal or discussion forum, where people in the community can network and support each other. She hypothesized that adding a Community Hub to our platforms for people to engage in discussions would be a good way to draw in more customers, more user engagement, and make us more competitive with similar products.
