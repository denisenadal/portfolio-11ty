We successfully delivered the promised feature to customers, but the results revealed fundamental assumptions we hadn't tested.

### What We Discovered

<h4 class="mb-1 mt-3">1. Usage Pattern Mismatch</h4>

Our platforms served a "find and go" user journey - people came with specific needs, found resources, and left. This didn't align with the sustained engagement required for community building.

<h4 class="mb-1 mt-3">2. Maintenance Burden</h4>

Communities require active moderation, outreach, and ongoing engagement. Our customers were already stretched thin with their core responsibilities and couldn't take on community management duties.

<h4 class="mb-1 mt-3">3. Audience Reality</h4>

The platforms lacked the regular, returning audience necessary for organic community growth. Without consistent users, discussions never gained momentum.

### Quantitative Results

- **Low engagement rates** across all customer implementations
- **Minimal user-generated content** despite available functionality
- **Zero organic community growth** without active intervention
