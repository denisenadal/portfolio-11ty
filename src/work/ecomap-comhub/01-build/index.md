Because we were moving fast, our research process mainly consisted of looking at other community platforms, discussion forums, and social media apps to understand common design patterns and workflows.  Designing the UI and designing the architecture and data structures all happened concurrently within a few days.

This feature was mainly built by our primary developer, Shua, and together we did QA before releasing the feature.
