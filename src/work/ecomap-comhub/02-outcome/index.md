We delivered the feature that was sold to customers, but it didn’t have a lot of engagement. It was something of an unsuccessful feature because it exposed that these platforms didn’t have a regular audience - that wasn’t the purpose - you came, you found what you needed and you go on your way. 

While adding a social component was a good idea for creating engagement, we needed to find a way to bring people there in the first place. Another issue we discovered after releasing the feature is that communities require maintenance, moderation and outreach, and our customers were already too busy with their regular tasks to add community moderation to their workload. 

If I had the opportunity to do it over again, I would like to explore having a chatbot that engages with users when they post to the community hub, and also occasionally starts discussions.
