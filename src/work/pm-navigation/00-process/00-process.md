Our Product Director challenged the UX Team to explore new ways of allowing users to quickly discover common tasks
without having to dig through onerous and dated navigation systems.

For our first round, I explored three methods of revealing tasks:

1. A classic text index of tasks for technology adverse users.
2. A metro grid style to make it easy for users on devices to find and click things.
3. A weighted system that increased the prominence of tasks the more that users interacted with those tasks, and slowly
hid ones users avoided.
