Our previous release made it easier to look up a person or their home, and schedule work, but it didn't make it much easier to look at information about them. I began exploring options whenever I had a spare moment, beginning to do **user research** by **interviewing our target audience, writing stories and scenarios to test designs,** and **organizing the information architecture** on the page. 

Through this process, I managed to condense ten screens of information into one. I tested it internal users and received positive feedback. However, it was several months before it was prioritized for implementation.
