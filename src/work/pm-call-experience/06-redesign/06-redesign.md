### Full Redesign 
(Nov, Dec 2019)

After several failed attempts to inject user-focused experiences into the existing codebase, we as a team came to the conclusion that it would take just as long, or perhaps less time, to just try again from scratch.  We decided to "do it right" this time, and start by challenging our assumptions and researching our users, their tasks, needs and wants. 

We never implemented this redesign as we ran out of runway.
