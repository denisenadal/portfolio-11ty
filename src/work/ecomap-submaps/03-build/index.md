<div class="col col-12 sm-7 md-6 lg-7">
We had one primary developer working on this project, and the founder and myself assisted with building. My area of focus with the building was ensuring UI consistency and mobile responsiveness. We also had the support of the data engineering team to provide the back end infrastructure. 

During this process, we abruptly lost our founder, and had to pivot on who was assigned what tickets, and I took over the product  management of the feature.
