During the initial design process, we had some concern that we might be designing to specifically for our early customers, and not designing broadly enough; but we were happy to discover that it had more applications and use cases that we were expecting. 

One of the surprising benefits of this feature was that it enabled customer expansion - for instance, a county might buy an ecomap initially, and as people start using it, and they more buy-in, a regional area or state might want to expand upon the county’s ecomap. 

Another surprising benefit was for accommodating internal politics for our customers. Ecosystem mapping is a collaborative process, and requires several organizations to work together. People don’t always get along, or agree on focus. Using submaps could also allow us to support dividing up platforms by organization, so they could each showcase their own sets of resources separately. Later on, we expanded upon this feature to allow submaps to have independent domains and branding, to further separate our organizations that might not want to appear to be associating with each other.

Overall, this feature enabled us to sell to more customers, and to bigger customers, allowing our sales team to grow contract sizes from 20-30K to 60K-90K, which significantly increased our revenue.
