With delivery pressure mounting, we implemented a "divide and conquer" approach that prioritized both speed and consistency.

### Design Strategy

- **Modular approach** - Each designer owned specific feature modules
- **Shared design system** - Leveraged Figma components for consistency
- **Daily synchronization** - Regular reviews to align on workflow and style
- **Real-time iteration** - Immediate feedback loops to prevent divergence

### Integrated Planning

As designs were completed, I translated them into detailed engineering tickets, working closely with our development team to identify backend requirements and edge cases. This parallel process kept momentum high while ensuring technical feasibility.

**Key Process Innovation:** Writing user stories during design helped establish our testing framework before development even began.
