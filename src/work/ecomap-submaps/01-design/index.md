Because we had a tight delivery timeline, as a design team, we chose to divide and conquer. We each focused on designing out different modules of the feature. Because of the risk of our designs not matching in style or workflow, we used a Figma design system with components, and had daily syncs to review each others work and revise as needed, or plan ahead.
