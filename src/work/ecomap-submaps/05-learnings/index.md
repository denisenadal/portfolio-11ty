## Key Learnings

**Design for flexibility, not just requirements.** Our concern about over-designing for specific customers was unfounded - the flexible architecture enabled use cases we never anticipated.

**Cross-functional collaboration accelerates delivery.** The parallel design-development process and daily syncs prevented bottlenecks despite our aggressive timeline.

**Product management requires adaptability.** Stepping into PM mid-project taught me the importance of maintaining stakeholder relationships while managing technical delivery.

**Customer feedback drives innovation.** The most valuable features (domain independence, branding separation) emerged from post-launch customer conversations.

## Next Steps

The submaps feature has become core to our enterprise strategy, with a major enhancement added in early 2024. We're now applying the collaborative design process to all of our complex feature development.

*This project demonstrated how thoughtful design for enterprise needs can unlock new market segments while creating unexpected value for existing customers.*
