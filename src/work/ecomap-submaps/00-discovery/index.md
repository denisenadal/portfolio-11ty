During the summer of 2023, we had several large, enterprise level customers come to us with a need for displaying multiple nested datasets.

For instance, a statewide university system might want to have a platform to showcase all of the different resources available to students across the entire university system, and subsets of data that only showcase the resources that apply to a specific campus.  This use case also applied to large metropolitan areas that span several counties, or a state with different regions. 

Through discussions with several customers and prospects, our founder identified a clear product need that would be a differentiator from other products in the same space.  She outlined the product requirements, and we got to work designing and planning.
