Summer 2023 brought an exciting challenge: multiple enterprise customers approached us with a common need that our platform couldn't yet address. A statewide university system wanted to showcase resources across their entire network while also providing campus-specific views. Large metropolitan areas spanning multiple counties needed the same capability. The pattern was clear - our customers needed to display complex, nested datasets with flexible hierarchical views.

## Strategic Foundation

Our founder recognized this wasn't just a feature request - it was a competitive differentiator that could unlock an entirely new customer segment. The requirements were ambitious: enable organizations to create comprehensive ecosystem maps while supporting granular, context-specific views for different audiences.

<h3 class="mt-0">The Challenge</h3>

- **Tight timeline** with multiple enterprise deals dependent on delivery
- **Complex technical requirements** for nested data architecture
- **Design consistency risk** across multiple team members working in parallel
- **Unknown scalability** - would this work beyond our initial use cases?
