<div class="col col-12 sm-7 md-6 lg-7">
Our founder outlined most of the work that needed to be done, and I added details to the engineering tickets based on the designs, and discussions with the engineers on what work was required under the hood that I might have been missing.  Through this process, I wrote user stories to help us with performing testing later on.

Most of this was done immediately as a modules design was completed, to keep things running as quickly as possible.
