What started as a solution for nested data display evolved into a platform transformation with multiple unexpected benefits.

<div class="bg-seafoam p-2 my-2">
<h3 class="mt-0">Quantitative Impact</h3>

- **Contract values increased 3x** - from $20-30K to $60-90K
- **Enterprise customer expansion** enabled through hierarchical capabilities
- **Revenue growth** through larger deal sizes and customer expansion

</div>

### Unexpected Use Cases

**1. Customer Expansion Engine**

Counties purchasing initial ecosystem maps led to regional and state-level expansions as stakeholder buy-in grew organically.

**2. Political Accommodation Tool**

The feature solved internal politics challenges by allowing organizations to maintain separate branded submaps while participating in broader collaborative efforts.

**3. Brand Independence**

Later expansion to support independent domains and branding enabled partnerships between organizations that preferred not to appear directly associated.
