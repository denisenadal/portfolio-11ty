We were on a tight deadline to complete the redesign, so I focused on creating a simple clean design that emphasized the content and services the client provides. The client had an established color scheme of blue & silver, which I used in conjunction with architectural serif fonts to create a feeling of monumental design, class, and luxurious architecture.
