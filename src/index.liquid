about:
  title: Design Leader
  subtitle: I like to design software & teams
  desc: I am a passionate leader, mentor and contributor with extensive experience in UX Design, Web Development and Product Management. I enjoy thinking wholistically about products and experiences as a designer, while also having a technical background allowing me to zoom and focus on the details. As someone who can design and code, I thrive in a collaborative environment where I can bridge the gap between design and development. I approach all my work with empathy and compassion for customers and users, open communication and a collaborative mindset towards my team, and ownership and accountability for delivering successful solutions. I'm always open to learning about new opportunities to grow.
